## Overview 
Providing temperature data from the months of June and December for the purpose of informin a bussiness related decision in the sustainability of opening a surfing and Ice Cream shop in Oahu.  

## Results 
Key statistical differences between June and December. 

![June Temperature Data](https://github.com/just-yen/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/June_temp.PNG) ![December Temperature Data](https://github.com/just-yen/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec_temp.PNG)
  - There is a 4 degrees difference between June and December. It is safe to make this assumption since the median is the point of comparison between the two datasets.
  - There is a noteable difference in minimum temperature between June and December at 8 degrees. Assuming the dataset is collected on fahrenheit, it is reasonable to expect a noteable decrease in Ice Cream sales in December comapred to June.
  - Between June and December, the expected difference in maximum termperature is only 2 degrees. 
  
  ## Summary 
  The good news is there does not seem to be a whole lot of variance in temperature data between June and December! The surfing and Ice Cream shop MAY just work!! However, it would be a good idea to compare the temperature data between two additional months as well. 
  
  ![March Temperature Data](https://github.com/just-yen/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/March_temp.PNG) ![November Temperature Data](https://github.com/just-yen/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Nov_temp.PNG)
    
  - With a median temperature of 70 degrees in March and 74 degrees in November. It is reasonable to expect that Ice Cream sales will decrease significantly until June rolls around. This is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between Ice Cream purchases and temperature. 
  - It would be best to optimize Ice Cream sales during the seasons of June to November, as there is only a difference in the median temperature by 1 degrees. I would suggest making Ice Cream purchase orders and stock management with this in mind.
